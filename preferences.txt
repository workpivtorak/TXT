I really like watching movies. My favorite genres are science fiction and travel movies. 
It is difficult to name the most favorite.
When it comes to food, I love pizza, but what I like most is my wife's author's dish - chicken in sweet sauce.
I like to travel, but it's best to do it in the spring. Once upon a time, my family and I would definitely visit the United States. 
The first place will be the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.
