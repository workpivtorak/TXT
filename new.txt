Hi! My name is Yurii. I am 30. 
I am from Illintsy, thats town in Vinnitsya region in Ukraine.
I am the father of two children. We have 2 dogs in our family. 
I am a Qa/Qc tester since 2021 and i work a freelancer.
I don't have much experience, but I learn quickly and easily adapt to working in a team.
As for me, for a start, I would like a salary of 500$. 
I want to note that for me the opportunity to gain real experience is important.
